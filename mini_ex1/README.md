## My first independent coding process

In my first coding process I was very curious, and tried to do a lot of different things. I found it interesting to try out different sample codes, and modifying the numbers to make the objects change color, be bigger or smaller, change the position of them or change the speed in which they moved. Sometimes the process was frustrating, because often I was not able to add more things to my project without it not showing the previous things I had made. For example, if I had a moving 3D shape, I was not able to also add text to the project. I decided to ultimately create a project that contained shapes that would move in relation to the mouse. The colors of the shapes depend on the angle they are seen from, due to the added light feature. I also changed the size and color of the background so that it worked better on a full-screen. There were although also some things that I wanted to change in my project, that I was not able to do. I am not satisfied with the colors of the shapes; I would like for them to be independent colors. Also, I am not satisfied with the “pink” color, but it was the best color I was able to make. 

The thing that I found myself thinking about the most, is that you are really not able to add many different things to one project (ex. 2d and 3d, 3d and text, or something entirely different). As soon as you try, it stops working. This to me was very frustrating, since I could make every individual code work in its own project. This limited my final product a lot. 


## How my coding process is different/similar to reading and writing text 

I think coding processes are very similar to the process of reading and writing text. Often the words that you use to create a command is a word that you already know, and therefore it makes sense. When you read codes like background() or ellipse(), you generally get an idea of what the code is used for. Also, the general structure of the codes; the things places on top are shown first, and the things further down are shown second (hereby being places in front of what is on top), reminds me of how you would read a text: from top to bottom. But even though the process of coding and the process of reading and writing are similar, they also differ in many ways, and consequently learning to be good at coding is similar to learning a new language. Therefore, I also do see the comparison to literacy. I see how learning this computer language is a way to gain access to information about how programs work and are being made, which in today’s society is very relevant, since we use these technologies all the time.


## The potential and possibility of coding practice 

The way that I find coding practice most relevant for me at a current time, is as a way to visualize ideas in a more interactive and creative idea. You are able to tweak and play with the codes a lot, hereby being able to create something that has potentially not been made before. I think the skill of being able to code is a very useful skill to have, because I imagine that I am going to find myself in a lot of situations where I will be able to use it, and benefit from knowing it. The knowledge will also make it a lot easier to read other people’s codes, and understand the general idea behind it. So even though I might not use the skill so often myself, I will still be able to communicate with other people about coding.
