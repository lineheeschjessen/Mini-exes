MY FIRST INDEPENDENT CODING PROCESS

In my first coding process I was very curious, and tried to do a lot of different things. I found it interesting to try out different sample codes, and modifying the numbers to make them change color, be bigger or smaller, change the position of them or change the speed in which they moved. Sometimes the process was frustrating, because often I was not able to add more things to my project without it not showing the precious things I had made. For example, if I had a moving 3D shape, I was not able to also add text to the project. I decided to ultimately create a project that contained shapes that would move in relation to the mouse. The colors of the shapes depend on the angle they are seen from, due to the added light feature. I also changed the size and color of the background so that it worked better on a full-screen.
