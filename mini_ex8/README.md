### For this mini_ex I worked together with Helena Smed

Helena and I created a program that allows you to search for any word, and then a headline from the newspaper "The Guardian", including this specific word, will appear on the black screen. You can continuously search for anything that you like, for as long as you please. The reason for choosing this API was that we found text and literacy to be quite interesting to work with, and thought it would be fun to be able to search for specific words, and see in what context the newspaper could have been using these. 

I still find using API's a bit confusing, and my understanding of what specific information this API holds is limited as well. Luckily, I worked together with Helena, who knew a lot more on how to do it, than me, which helped a lot. Even though I find it confusing, I too find working with API really interesting and relevant. I think it is really cool how we are able to get access to some websites API, and hereby get access to the information that is on there, in a different way. For example, as we used it to sort through different headlines that had a relation to the specific search word, and then not show anything else. It is interesting how you can manipulate this large amount of data however you want, and it is something I did not know was possible before learning about API's. Something I also find interesting is how these websites sort out what data you can get access to using this API, and what you cannot. This is also important, because it accentuates the values that these websites put into their specific data, when they chose to not allow access to it. Why would some data need to be unavailable, and some not? 

If I am to formulate a question referring to working with API's, I would like to get a better understanding of why these websites want their API to be available for anyone to use, and also if there would be any way for you to use multiple API's in one program?
