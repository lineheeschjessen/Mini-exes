## Description of my program 

My program is a static drawing. It has been made from a sketch I found online and tried to recreate. I added another picture, to create a more colourful background, and to make the drawing stand out a bit more. The main syntax's that I used were curveVertex(); and vertex();. Also, I used loadImage(); for both the sketch of the dog, and the picture in the background. The main thing I did to create this program was to locate the coordinates where I wanted my lines to be (by using console.log(mouseX, mouseY);), and hereby drawing on top of the sketch of the dog that I found online. The process was not difficult, but it definitely was very time consuming. I ended up with a very long code and a lot of vertexes, and this made the process frustrating, because it actually didn't make a lot of sense. I could easily have made the drawing in a lot of other programs, such as Photoshop, and it would have taken not even half as long as this did to make. But in the end it still was very satisfying to look at the result (which is far from perfect), and I think that I have mastered the vertex syntax now.  

## What is fun about my program?

What I find "fun" about my program is the fact that it doesn't really make a lot of sense. As mentioned, a lot of other programs could have been used to create this drawing, and it would have been both faster and probably prettier, but this mini exercise goes to show that there really isn't any limit to programming, and you can create whatever you want, even though it may not be the best way to do it. As Goriunova mentions, programming does not always have to make a lot of sense, but can provoke different thoughts, and can be fun. My program does not consist of any functionality, it was just meant to be fun to create, and fun to look at for a short amount of time.
